# on the puppet master (i.e. as puppet@puppet.example.org)
# Once logged in as puppet on the puppetmaster this script will create, update,
# or delete the environment directory. This includes updating any git submodules
# and running librarian puppet if a Puppetfile exists in the environment
# directory after the git update/clone.
